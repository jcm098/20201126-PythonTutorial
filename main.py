Dear PYer,
I am confused about how you said you could use triple quotes to make
SUPER
LONG
COMMENTS
!

I am wondering if this is true,
and if so, 
I am wondering if this is correct.

Could you help me with this?

Thanks,
Random guy who used your tutorial.

print('Testing')

x = 5
y = 7
z = x*y # 35
print(z) # => 35

x = 5
x = str(x)
b = '5'
b = int(b)
print('x = ', x, '; b = ', str(b), ';') # => x = 5; b = 5;
print('x = '+ x+ '; b = '+ str(b)+ ';') # => x = 5; b = 5;
